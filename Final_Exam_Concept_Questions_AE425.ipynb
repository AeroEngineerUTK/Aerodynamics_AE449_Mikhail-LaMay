    "- What are the requirements for an aircraft to be in a trim state, what are the forces present, and how are those forces calculated?\n",
    "    - The requirements to be in a trim state is “nose-up” trim. This is required in most aircraft to maintain steady level flight. Nose-up trim involves setting the tail surfaces to produce a greater down load on the aft portion of the fuselage, which adds to the wing loading and the total lift required from the wing if altitude is to be maintained.\n",

    "        - When two or more objects exert forces on each other, their total momentum always stays the same. This is called the law of conservation of momentum, and it helps to explain why aircraft and rockets move. A rocket engine sends out a highspeed jet of gas when it is fired.\n",
    "    - Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation)\n",
    "        - The basis of the conservation of mass principle for fluid mechanics is that mass can neither be created nor destroyed within the volume or system of interest. If the inflow mass flow rate is not balanced by the outflow mass flow rate, then there will be a change in volume or density within the volume of interest.\n",
